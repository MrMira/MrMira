### Hello. I'm Miguel. I'm graduated as bachelor of science technology at UFABC and I like programming!

I have strong interest in architecture and performance of enterprise applications and low-level programming in general.

I participated in a student organization about hacking called Green Team Hacker Club (GTHC) where I taught programming to freshmen.
