### Hello. My name is Miguel. I'm graduate as bachelor of science technology at the UFABC and I like programming!

I have strong interest in architecture and performance of enterprise applications and low-level programming in general.
I participate in a student organization about hacking called Green Team Hacker Club (GTHC) where I teach programming to freshmen.
